Playtesters:
-Michael Muse
-Stephen Muse
-Octavio Zuniga

Notes:
-Delayed controls: Perhaps just due to slow to start animation. Sound might improve (responsiveness)
-Blocks having 3 functions seems confusing
 -Not pushable
 -Pushable once
 -Appear/Disappear
-Tried to activate banners, maybe we could put secrets behind them
-Unsure what the tables were supposed to look like
-It is not obvious when weapons are switched, and it is easy to forget after you have switched weapons
-Should activate and attack be the same button?
-It's not obvious that pushing the block moved it, so one player kept activating it
-Should bombs self damage?
-Should the doors be opened by just walking into them?
-Unsure what the arrow was at first
-its easy to pickup items that enemies drop without noticing what they you picked up
 perhaps do a zelda thing where the item appears above your head?
-No one used the block feature, keep experimenting to see if it has it's place.

Lessons learned:
-Using sound as a tool to communicate to the player that things have happened will likely eliminate
 a lot of the confusion about game mechanic interactions
-A visual indicator on the player himself

Bugs found:
-When dead, player can still attack
-When player is hit, it's possible for them to take damage twice
-When killed by a projectile, we don't respawn the player
